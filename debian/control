Description: Infiniband/iWARP Kernel Module Initializer
 User space initialization scripts for the kernel InfiniBand/iWARP drivers.
 rdma-utils package allows InfiniBand users to manage user-level RDMA protocols that
 want to be loaded by default, change port type to Ethernet or InfiniBand and
 manage the SR-IOV for Mellanox ConnectX family adapter cards.
 The rdma service is user space initialization scripts for the kernel InfiniBand
 /iWARP drivers.
 It reads the /etc/rdma/rdma.conf file to find out which kernel-level and
 user-level RDMA protocols the administrator wants to be loaded by default. This
 file can be modified to turn various drivers ON or OFF.
