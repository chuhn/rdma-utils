This package seems to originate from a conversion of the Redhat rdma-core package.

The original sources seem to live at https://github.com/linux-rdma/rdma-core

The contents of this repository lives in the redhat subdir of that repository.

A Debian package for rdma-core exists already: https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/rdma-core
